A little program I made when I discovered a stuck pixel on my new monitor :( <br>
A stuck pixel is not the same as a dead pixel, A dead pixel is just blacked out while a stuck pixel is stuck on one color.<br>

The app is 150x150 pixels, simply move the window so that it covers or contains the stuck pixel, choose a setting you want to try and then let it run for a while (most places suggest 20 minutes or more).
This works by cycling the stuck pixel through different values at 60 frames per second, and this has a chance to "unstick" the stuck pixel<br>
This won't hurt most monitors as they're designed to cycle through different values and high rates of speed while gaming for hours a time, but if you have an older monitor or a TV, you can try a lower framerate to closer match movies and TV shows.<br>

Based on jscreenfix, a free browser-based app that does the same thing, but requires the browser window to be open, taking up space<br>
Having a standalone app allows for me to still use the rest of the monitor while it attempts to unstick the pixel.<br>

Features:<br>
Window "stays on top" so you can do other things on the monitor while it runs.<br>
User can cycle through all the modes with the WASD or directional arrow keys.<br>

color modes:<br>
red, green, blue, white, cyan, magenta, yellow, random color, random grayscale<br>

style modes:<br>
Full screen swap between black and a color<br>
per-pixel randomized either black or a color<br>
per-pixel randomized grayscale or color<br>
