A little program I made when I discovered a stuck pixel on my new monitor :( <br>
A stuck pixel is not the same as a dead pixel, A dead pixel is just blacked out while a stuck pixel is stuck on one color.<br>

This works by generating random colors for every pixel in a 150x150 window at 60 FPS, and this has a chance to "unstick" the stuck pixel<br>

Based on jscreenfix, a free browser-based app that does the same thing, but requires the browser window to be open, taking up space<br>
having a standalone app allows for me to still use the rest of the monitor while it attempts to unstick the pixel.<br>

Features:<br>
window "stays on top" so you can do other things on the monitor while it runs.<br>
